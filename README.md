# ClientServer
Client Server java code to transfer a zip file

# Introduction 
This repository focuses on Client Server code to share a zip file from server to the client connected using Socket class in Java.

# Changes
In the Client.java file change <Server-IP> to the IP of the machine which is running Server.java and specify the port number on which server is running in place of <port>.
In Server.java specify the port number which you want the Server to run on.

# Drawbacks
This Client Server program does not have Security features like TLS/SSL.
So the transmission will not be a secure connection.
